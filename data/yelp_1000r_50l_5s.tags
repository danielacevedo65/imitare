Excellent food. Superb customer service. I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition.Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The "Wet Cajun" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!

The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  "Pittsburgh Dad" would love this place n'at!!I highly recommend this place. The mechanics are really honest and I'm usually in and out with no issues.I am a big believer in first impressions, so when I go to a new business I pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business. Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true. He's earned my repeat business immediately. Give him a call, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Joe!THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!!This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's "25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.Old school.....traditional "mom 'n pop" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback
ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.Like a lot of recent patrons, I heard about Emil's from WQED.  The food is spectacular, the owner Chrissy and the staff treat you like family.  The food is like something your grandmother would make - classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable.After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.

Also, the food is really good. :)I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

Overall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy 
Is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the tripAwesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well.Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. 

You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once.Friendly staff, good food, great beer selection, and relaxing atmosphere. Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place.Found this place on Yelp and glad we did. Great beer selection, the sandwiches are wonderful and huge, wings were very good. Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great, the owner, waitstaff and kitchen staff.  If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again, we will go back!Awesome experience!   I came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule. 

They saw me and worked on my car like a NASCAR pit crew.

I was prepared to buy new tires.  They offered to look to see if they could repair.

They repaired them.  I saved alot of money.  #integrity #greatcustomerserviceOur cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight. He was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries. My girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately.  When we got there, I couldn't believe how friendly and caring they all were. We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn't have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don't care about the animals in 90% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places. I will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and Doctor Kelly to everyone I know. Thank you so much again if you read this. Doctors Kelley you're the best.Greentree Animal clinic is the absolute best!  We have had both Dr Mann and Dr. Reuther.  Both are very good, each in their own strengths.  I recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip.  Dr. Mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss.  He offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed.  He went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side.  Thank you for allowing me that experience, and for guiding me through the process.I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:
* They do not over charge
* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way
* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays
* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. 
* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. 

Thankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.Beautiful restoration of the library and music hall.   Look forward to coming here for shows.Great people... great service... great products... always busyThis SnS and the one in Bethel Park are my two favorites.  Staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great!  In my experience, if teen staff don't know where something is, they ask another staff member.  Shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets.I went to Rossi's for my first time, two weeks ago. I had two suits and one jacket tailored. Everything was ready in less than two weeks. These suits were brand new and on the expensive side. I didn't know who to trust them with. I went to Rossi's because a friend highly recommended them. My friend had a tuxedo custom made by Rossi's. 

I am extremely happy with the end results!

I wanted a European cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look. The suits look awesome. I'm going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored (some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; I now like the more tailored European look). Juliano (the owner) will shorten the length of my jackets, take the sides in and shorten my slacks. They'll look brand new.

As for the price, I'm very happy. I wouldn't go to the cheapest barber in town (for obvious reason). I feel the same about a good tailor. As for the service, they couldn't be nicer. 

Thanks for a job well done!I want to write the greatest review Yelp has ever seen. I want Yelpers from all across this great land to read this review and think to themselves "I wish I could write a review like this one." This review must be honest, to the point, be the subject of debates and casual comversation. It should be humorous too, not so humorous that it loses it's methodology. It should make you want to go to this establishment and see it for yourself. When you get here, you fall to you knees and scream "It truely is indeed a Mecca" 

This review must compel Yelpers from all over the world to come to Pittsburgh to see this attraction that I have  written about. I want people from India, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Germany, France, and even the little countries like Wyoming and Pluto to gather here and praise me to the highest, seat me at right hand of you know who, and sing me the Ava Maria and Bett Midler's version of The Boogie Woogie Bugal Boy.

Once I leave this big blue marble, I want people to remember me as the man who wrote the greatest Yelp review ever. People will bring children to my grave and say to them "you should read his review, for it was the most honest, thoughtful, and heartfelt review ever written. Flawless, it flows like a gentle brook on a spring day." My reviews will be the subject of future thesises, lectures, and studied by philosophers.

And now, without further adeu, my greatest review...

This is a gas station.If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.
Enjoy....This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new "go to" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do.Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky'sStick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.

Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have "dippy" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a "dippy" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. 

Here are the highlights:

-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.
-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)
-Cash only
-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack
-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.
-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayoLove this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half).BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.

It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast.Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, "We need mugs" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.

Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in.Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious.I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill."  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.

We want to return sometime for "turkey day."  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!

Can't wait to return.This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates.On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon

The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.

Totally recommended. Come hungry.Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for?I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service.Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. 
Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down.What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. 
Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00.Been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and I get the chance, and have NEVER been disappointed!

The perfect blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance,friendly older waitresses who have been there since I started going, cheap for what you get prices, and food with taste and amounts that "Aunt Bee" would be proud of.

Never had anything that wasn't hot,freshly made before my eyes,and down home "gooooooooooood"' as Andy might say.

As my wife and I agree,this "joint", has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against!

One visit...and you will be a believer, and most times I've been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself.A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended.Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.Great food, great service, and a great "diner" atmosphere.  It's the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends.One of my favorite breakfast stops in Pittsburgh! Can't beat the hometown feel of this place. Always had great service.One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. The local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  

Mixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. 

Their burgers are up there with the best in Pittsburgh. 

A hidden gem. Don't miss it.What a great diner!  Yummy food, friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere.  This is a place you have to try.  Then you will keep coming back.THE best breakfast place BY FAR. I never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and French toast.Great greasy spoon!

Arrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!

We had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!

Great diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. 

Coffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!

Cash only - be prepared.Wonderful omelets, coffee, and staff! The prices are great and the food is prepared quickly! Veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite!They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and "Hey Rayed" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!This place is great. Best ham and cheese inlet I've ever had! Their burgers are also delicious. Nice flat-top crust on the burger. I only wish they were open for dinner too!This place is by far the best place for breakfast....but today...I decided to get lunch. {Only because it was lunch time...but they do serve breakfast at this time, too.}. I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it was delish.  Too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here.Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often.Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpfulI have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends.New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.

I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. 

Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business.I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.

Oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!This is the best alteration place I have been to. The guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works FAST. Also, the prices are so reasonable I wonder how he stays in business. He was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating. The alteration I needed done--and fast--was right in the middle of prom season. All the other places I called gave me a several week wait, but he took me right away. I will be back!I just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite Penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed.  The price was very reasonable and the work done was great.  I will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done.So happy I found this place! I'm new to the Pittsburgh area and wasn't sure if it was worth driving to Carnegie to come here, but Yelp convinced me. It was completely worth the trip! Since it would have been a long trip to come back, the guys at Alteration World finished my work (patching a hole on a pair of jeans) in less than half an hour (I killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street) and exactly as I had specified. Oh, and the price was extremely reasonable as well. Thanks Yelp for another great find!My bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect. I would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning.The service, quality, and speed of Alteration World are incredible! I have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work. Everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality. I will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have referred many customers already. If you need anything altered (or even something custom made), do not hesitate to go to Alteration World.I really don't understand these reviews.  I have used Greetree Auto Body for years and they have been absolutely wonderful.  They are a preferred shop with most insurance companies and it is because they do very good work at reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend Greentree Auto Body to anyone.It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant.All I need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see Dr. Weinberg and her staff! Not only are they professional and kind,  they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care!  This busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments, at the same time.  I can't imagine having a better family dentist!Just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey.  She did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it.  I was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening.  I've gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed.  The doctor is great and so are the staff.  I would recommend going here.The crew at West Penn Dental Centers is fantastic.  I'm always greeted with a smile at the front desk and everyone working there is very friendly.  Dr. Steines is an exceptional dentist and every one of the hygienists that have cleaned my teeth are exceptionally personable and well skilled at their craft.  The practice is small but clean and cozy.  A previous review claims that it's in a shady part of Carnegie.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The office is on a nice street with a large parking lot just off of Main Street.  They also provide easy scheduling with email & text confirmations so you don't forget your appointment.  I highly recommend West Penn Dental.Good quality work and really nice staff. They definitely don't treat you like a number.The office has been in Carnegie forever. I have been going there for years and have always had good direct communication about anything I need. My questions are always answered and I will continue with my dentist as long as he's there.Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!
Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) 
Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!
Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. 
If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!Excellent food , good service too I have had several different dishes here and all have been excellentI like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  
There is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.
I love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN.This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. 

I grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town.

Try the fried calamari "Roman Style" for a little kick!What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back.I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well.It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.

The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.

I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.

I have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.

I love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old.

We always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.

We, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience.This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. 

I moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?

I bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. 

When my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time.Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave.Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back.One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically). 

Everything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  

Then, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  

If you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).I have never posted to Yelp before, but in light of the very unpleasant experience had by our friend Katie, I figured I'd share a happier one. I LOVE the food, the prices are great and I think I'm addicted to their cheesesteaks! The staff is always funny and down to earth, they make delivery to my job speedy, and they even deal with my indecisiveness! (haha). If something was wrong with my food, I am sure they'd waste no time fixing the problem.
I always order a side of fries as they're HUGE and taste like Potato Patch (Kennywood) UHH-MAY-ZIIING. I would and do DEFINITELEY recommend Capri Pizza

***PLEASE NOTE***

 I do not stand in opposition to Katie, I really am sorry to hear of the unhappy experience, but I will say that I really do like Capri and I appreciate their staff.Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long.Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. 

Outdoor seating in the summer is nice.It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.Piano Man to the tune of Gangster's Paradise...what more do I have to say? Get there early if you want a seat, $7 cover and really fun crowd. We had sucha great time and I can't wait to go back.SingSing!!! What a blast! One of my favorite places to jam on Earth!! Cool bar, cool town, cool people... What else do you need!! The piano players are great, funny, semi-good lookin'... I mean dude, you gotta go!!! :) Love me some SingSing!If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.

Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  

I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!

It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! 

I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! 

I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!Went for my 25th birthday and had a blast! Servers are great, the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved. Only bad thing is it can get very expensive!What a great time! The pianists are funny, talented, and just a tad crude. But just enough to be funny.Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend.I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.

Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an "i" not an "l") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.

Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them.From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio's, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!

If you don't want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!

-AdamJoe Dilorio's Auto Body Shop was so helpful when I needed to get windows replaced. The were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area. They were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with. I'm planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs.This place is amazing! I needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful. They set me up with a rental car as soon as I dropped my car off, repaired my car in a timely manner, detailed it for free, and their customer service was unbelievable!!! I can't recommend this place more!I'm grateful to my insurance company for recommending Di Iorio's Auto Body Shop. After an accident, I needed some body work done as soon as possible. The other recommended shops wouldn't even make an appointment to see me for days. These guys fit me in that afternoon, and coordinated the rental too. Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense. The car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few days later, I noticed they had buffed out some scratches that weren't even part of the repair area. I will definitely be back next time I need auto repairs.SO lucky to be referred to Joe DiIorio's after moving to Pittsburgh. It's really invaluable to have "car guys" that you trust. I could detail several experiences here (in comparison to other chain shops), but suffice it to say that they've always been honest, helpful, and fair.You can find pretty good body work without too much trouble.  Finding a place that's friendly, prompt, and organized that ALSO does good body work is more difficult.  Joe Dilorio's delivers on all counts.  Highly recommended for the next time you -- or somebody else -- make a little mistake on the road.Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn't see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill. The raccoon destroyed my front bumper, the grill, and my right fog light. Thankfully I had duct tape in my trunk. Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent.

My insurance referred me to DiIorios and I'm really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate. They even set up a rental for me when I was having the car repaired. 

They kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time.

Hopefully I don't have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon, but if I do, I know I'm going to take back to DiIorios.Lowe's is my goto store for home improvement supplies. It's convenient and local to me. 
Customer service is always great and prices are fair. 
My most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed! 
THIS is what I want in customer service. Sadly, I cannot remember his name. (Bad customer on my part.) Thank you!!!Lowe's is my first stop for all of my home projects.   I am currently redoing door.  Lowe's has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the DIYs as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs.   Returns are handled seamlessly,  who doesn't grab the wrong part?  Their garden section is great for Spring planting.  They have competatively priced appliances.  5% off with Lowe's credit card is also nice.  Having those large items delivered is a convenience. Their best asset is the expertise of the staff.  I frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input.   Highly recommendedThe food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.

They have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi.Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders.Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  

My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  

I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area.Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domesticI really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  
My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...
They often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)
Anyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  

A FAMILY GATHERING!  

A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  

OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!

A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!

The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  

The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.

The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.

Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. 

WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  

POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  

A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. 

Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  

DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!

FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.

The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.

Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.

The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. 

Note the "drinks are weak" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. 

Also note the "prize center games suck" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). 

The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.

This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.

Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.

I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxedAfter having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more.Great games and prizes. Amazing food.great way to enjoy your day with your family!!! Super busy place.We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.

Kids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.

In the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.This is a high quality,clean and professional grooming shop. I feel very comfortable leaving my golden retriever with this groomer.  The focus is on clean and natural and not fancy perfumes and gimmicks.The woman working who cut my 9 month old Schnauzer was wonderful! He was very matted, not to mention nervous for his first grooming, and she still managed to do a WONDERFUL job on him! I could not be happier, especially because the people at Petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didn't have the time for it being it was a busy Saturday. Paws in the Family Pet Grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard, his chest-fur, and the fur on his legs. He looks like a Schnauzer! I am so happy!great job always!!! 
i highly recommend!!!! ;-)
mandy & randy ;-)I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.
There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.
Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.
I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.
Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!!I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic "Team Trivia". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. 

A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! 

Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!!Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews!My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  

The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure.Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!I love this place! Great food and the best beer brewed on site! The bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here.BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. 

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! 

I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.

Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.

The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.

In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. 

If you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. 

Even though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. 
I had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. 
I would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.Great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones! You won't be disappointed. The Jalapeño pretzels are dope!I have a little bit of mechanical knowledge, but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic. I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. 

I called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. 

I chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. 

Thanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles. 

(If you're curious as to their hours, I was there a little after 7AM. They are first come, first serve.) Don't be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot. Oh, and don't park in front of the garage doors like a tool!Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend.This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:

1. They sell beer!
2. Huuuuuge produce selection
3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars
4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish
5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)

The store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. 

It seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.I have to thank the bakery, once again for getting me out of a jam! Twice, Bekka, has made a great cake for my daughter when party planning was at its stress point! Her guest interaction is very professional and she always makes everything seem easy and manageable without a ripple. Thanks again Bekka!!This is a great supermarket!  All of the staples.  Great deli, market square and bakery.  Fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged.  Love the fact that I can shop, drop dry cleaning, and pick up pharmacy items in one stop.  Close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants.Such nice staff.  

I really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  

The store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  

I really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.I find this location, clean and well organized, but that's not the reason it's getting 5 stars! 

I called today to look into whether or not their May issues of magazines were out (I need them for my job) and Erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine I asked about! 

Now that is customer service! 

Well done, well done!There is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store. 

This Barnes and Noble carries on a long history of excellence. They always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking.I'm surprised by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot, fresh pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge. 

They've got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.

In the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to "Do the wave' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. I've found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. Maybe these are old reviews?One of my favorite places, and they have thee Best Lemon Drop Martini's... Plus the Bar Tender looks like Clark Kent(Superman) very handsome guyGreat atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. 

Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant.The place where my fiancé and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now! 

Jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat. 
Buffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot tooI LOVE Sandcastle. 
First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. 

If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! 

The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!

They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. 

If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It's a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting!We went to the Sandcastle Waterpark this past weekend before we went to Heinz Field.  We are a family of four; Dad, Mom, 17 year old girl, and 8 year old girl.  We all enjoyed it.  There was plenty to do for everyone; wave pool, kiddie pools, single tube slides, double tube slides, and body slides.  It was a cloudy day in the upper 70's, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Check for coupons at Giant, Local Flavor, and other places.  Some things don't open until 12 PM, even when the park opens at 11 AM.  Parking is $6.00.For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. 

ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. 

I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? 

These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. 

Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.The only place to buy a mattress.

Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. 

Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.
 
Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. 

A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.

I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. 

My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.I agree with the other reviewers. I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. 

I'm a grumpy New Englander, and have been frustrated by the small town, easygoing/careless customer service at many PGH businesses. These guys are different: professional, punctual (even in snow!).Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.Ditto everyone else. I had out of towners needing to get to the airport but I had a last minute work conflict and couldn't drive them. I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment.We always use First Class Limo for flights too early to take the 28X to the airport.  They even have a multi-pickup service for early flights if you are not in time for a regular reservation.Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. 

My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!Excellent service! The driver was first class! Truly was the best car service I have ever experienced. Driver was classy, professional and kind. Great reservation service and very fair price. Do yourself a favor-skip the cab and call this car service. Reliable, professional and great value. Thank you!I'm not sure what it is about this place that I love so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 years now, and it NEVER disappoints. Its not fancy, its not unique, its not some fantastic restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! Everything I have ever ordered is good. The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet n sour, the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.

Affordable, fast, and delicious.Everyone's been to Fridays I am sure, but I enjoy the Yucatan Salad it's delicious. My children love Fridays it's usually there 1st choice. I also love the Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta very very good.While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. 

So this is the old style pizza hut. 

Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.

I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. 

Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza. 

I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. 

I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. 

It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  "No not personal...Regular." I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. 

It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage...
Until there was nothing left. 

I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious. 

But the fries were mediocre.I love this particular LOFT store! Everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing. The quality of clothes is really good and I do believe it's good value for money. They usually have more chic and classic clothes which I love. The staff is exceptional here. I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you "how beautiful everything looks on you". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area). This store feels more personal. Combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer!Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell "General Tso's" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again.Great food, great atmosphere, little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so it's much better, good service.I will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  We got seated quickly with a reservation.  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  The manager was also great.  We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.This place hit the spot. 

Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. 

I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)Good food, good service, and always an enjoyable visit. They forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us. A good place to catch a meal if you're down around the waterfront.I used to work here!  Haha, many moons ago tho.  Usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after I left I still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out.  

I'm a Changs Chicken junkie and I can't stay away from it for too long.  The bartenders have always been some of the best I've ever seen no matter how many changes they've gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it!  Says a lot about the people.  

Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pork Won Tons though are the standard fare are always amazing.  Some other excellent dishes are Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef and The Ahi Tuna.

It might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain!Thank you so very very very much to the management Hallie.  She literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card.  

Also Hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay.

 Also our server, Aaron, was really helpful and sweet.  I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   

Very rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together.This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!Gordons in the Waterfront is exactly what I needed for new shoes after I was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot.  The man who waited on me was kind, patient, and even let me know about a sale going on.  The selection and quality of shoes is wonderful.  You won't get cheap shoes here but you will get the best. Worth every cent.Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.Amazing amazing place and I really enjoy to eat there and drink the prices they not high, very good service and fast .Panera is one of our family's favorite restaurants. Everything is great. Kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup. Adults usually order "you pick two". Sandwiches, salad are all very good.I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.OMG. Target is my fav store ever. I love the staff they are also so helpful and friendly. They recognize me being there quite often!!! I also greatly appreciate being able to use a target coupon AND a manufacture coupon!!!!!  I save so much money shopping  there and now I save 5% everyday using my target debit card!!!!! Ah I love this store!!!!!!!Excellent food. Superb customer service. I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition.Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The "Wet Cajun" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!

The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  "Pittsburgh Dad" would love this place n'at!!I highly recommend this place. The mechanics are really honest and I'm usually in and out with no issues.I am a big believer in first impressions, so when I go to a new business I pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business. Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true. He's earned my repeat business immediately. Give him a call, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Joe!THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!!This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's "25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.Old school.....traditional "mom 'n pop" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback
ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.Like a lot of recent patrons, I heard about Emil's from WQED.  The food is spectacular, the owner Chrissy and the staff treat you like family.  The food is like something your grandmother would make - classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable.After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.

Also, the food is really good. :)I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

Overall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy 
Is a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the tripAwesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well.Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. 

You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once.Friendly staff, good food, great beer selection, and relaxing atmosphere. Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place.Found this place on Yelp and glad we did. Great beer selection, the sandwiches are wonderful and huge, wings were very good. Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great, the owner, waitstaff and kitchen staff.  If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again, we will go back!Awesome experience!   I came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule. 

They saw me and worked on my car like a NASCAR pit crew.

I was prepared to buy new tires.  They offered to look to see if they could repair.

They repaired them.  I saved alot of money.  #integrity #greatcustomerserviceOur cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight. He was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries. My girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately.  When we got there, I couldn't believe how friendly and caring they all were. We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn't have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don't care about the animals in 90% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places. I will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and Doctor Kelly to everyone I know. Thank you so much again if you read this. Doctors Kelley you're the best.Greentree Animal clinic is the absolute best!  We have had both Dr Mann and Dr. Reuther.  Both are very good, each in their own strengths.  I recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip.  Dr. Mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss.  He offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed.  He went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side.  Thank you for allowing me that experience, and for guiding me through the process.I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:
* They do not over charge
* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way
* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays
* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. 
* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. 

Thankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.Beautiful restoration of the library and music hall.   Look forward to coming here for shows.Great people... great service... great products... always busyThis SnS and the one in Bethel Park are my two favorites.  Staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great!  In my experience, if teen staff don't know where something is, they ask another staff member.  Shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets.I went to Rossi's for my first time, two weeks ago. I had two suits and one jacket tailored. Everything was ready in less than two weeks. These suits were brand new and on the expensive side. I didn't know who to trust them with. I went to Rossi's because a friend highly recommended them. My friend had a tuxedo custom made by Rossi's. 

I am extremely happy with the end results!

I wanted a European cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look. The suits look awesome. I'm going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored (some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; I now like the more tailored European look). Juliano (the owner) will shorten the length of my jackets, take the sides in and shorten my slacks. They'll look brand new.

As for the price, I'm very happy. I wouldn't go to the cheapest barber in town (for obvious reason). I feel the same about a good tailor. As for the service, they couldn't be nicer. 

Thanks for a job well done!I want to write the greatest review Yelp has ever seen. I want Yelpers from all across this great land to read this review and think to themselves "I wish I could write a review like this one." This review must be honest, to the point, be the subject of debates and casual comversation. It should be humorous too, not so humorous that it loses it's methodology. It should make you want to go to this establishment and see it for yourself. When you get here, you fall to you knees and scream "It truely is indeed a Mecca" 

This review must compel Yelpers from all over the world to come to Pittsburgh to see this attraction that I have  written about. I want people from India, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Germany, France, and even the little countries like Wyoming and Pluto to gather here and praise me to the highest, seat me at right hand of you know who, and sing me the Ava Maria and Bett Midler's version of The Boogie Woogie Bugal Boy.

Once I leave this big blue marble, I want people to remember me as the man who wrote the greatest Yelp review ever. People will bring children to my grave and say to them "you should read his review, for it was the most honest, thoughtful, and heartfelt review ever written. Flawless, it flows like a gentle brook on a spring day." My reviews will be the subject of future thesises, lectures, and studied by philosophers.

And now, without further adeu, my greatest review...

This is a gas station.If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.
Enjoy....This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky's.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn't pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new "go to" when I'm in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do.Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky'sStick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.

Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have "dippy" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a "dippy" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. 

Here are the highlights:

-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.
-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)
-Cash only
-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack
-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.
-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayoLove this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half).BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.

It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast.Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, "We need mugs" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.

Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in.Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious.I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill."  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.

We want to return sometime for "turkey day."  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!

Can't wait to return.This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates.On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon

The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.

Totally recommended. Come hungry.Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for?I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service.Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. 
Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down.What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. 
Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00.Been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and I get the chance, and have NEVER been disappointed!

The perfect blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance,friendly older waitresses who have been there since I started going, cheap for what you get prices, and food with taste and amounts that "Aunt Bee" would be proud of.

Never had anything that wasn't hot,freshly made before my eyes,and down home "gooooooooooood"' as Andy might say.

As my wife and I agree,this "joint", has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against!

One visit...and you will be a believer, and most times I've been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself.A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended.Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.Great food, great service, and a great "diner" atmosphere.  It's the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends.One of my favorite breakfast stops in Pittsburgh! Can't beat the hometown feel of this place. Always had great service.One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. The local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  

Mixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. 

Their burgers are up there with the best in Pittsburgh. 

A hidden gem. Don't miss it.What a great diner!  Yummy food, friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere.  This is a place you have to try.  Then you will keep coming back.THE best breakfast place BY FAR. I never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and French toast.Great greasy spoon!

Arrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!

We had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!

Great diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. 

Coffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!

Cash only - be prepared.Wonderful omelets, coffee, and staff! The prices are great and the food is prepared quickly! Veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite!They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and "Hey Rayed" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!This place is great. Best ham and cheese inlet I've ever had! Their burgers are also delicious. Nice flat-top crust on the burger. I only wish they were open for dinner too!This place is by far the best place for breakfast....but today...I decided to get lunch. {Only because it was lunch time...but they do serve breakfast at this time, too.}. I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it was delish.  Too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here.Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often.Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpfulI have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends.New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.

I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. 

Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business.I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.

Oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!This is the best alteration place I have been to. The guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works FAST. Also, the prices are so reasonable I wonder how he stays in business. He was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating. The alteration I needed done--and fast--was right in the middle of prom season. All the other places I called gave me a several week wait, but he took me right away. I will be back!I just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite Penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed.  The price was very reasonable and the work done was great.  I will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done.So happy I found this place! I'm new to the Pittsburgh area and wasn't sure if it was worth driving to Carnegie to come here, but Yelp convinced me. It was completely worth the trip! Since it would have been a long trip to come back, the guys at Alteration World finished my work (patching a hole on a pair of jeans) in less than half an hour (I killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street) and exactly as I had specified. Oh, and the price was extremely reasonable as well. Thanks Yelp for another great find!My bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect. I would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning.The service, quality, and speed of Alteration World are incredible! I have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work. Everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality. I will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have referred many customers already. If you need anything altered (or even something custom made), do not hesitate to go to Alteration World.I really don't understand these reviews.  I have used Greetree Auto Body for years and they have been absolutely wonderful.  They are a preferred shop with most insurance companies and it is because they do very good work at reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend Greentree Auto Body to anyone.It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant.All I need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see Dr. Weinberg and her staff! Not only are they professional and kind,  they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care!  This busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments, at the same time.  I can't imagine having a better family dentist!Just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey.  She did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it.  I was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening.  I've gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed.  The doctor is great and so are the staff.  I would recommend going here.The crew at West Penn Dental Centers is fantastic.  I'm always greeted with a smile at the front desk and everyone working there is very friendly.  Dr. Steines is an exceptional dentist and every one of the hygienists that have cleaned my teeth are exceptionally personable and well skilled at their craft.  The practice is small but clean and cozy.  A previous review claims that it's in a shady part of Carnegie.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The office is on a nice street with a large parking lot just off of Main Street.  They also provide easy scheduling with email & text confirmations so you don't forget your appointment.  I highly recommend West Penn Dental.Good quality work and really nice staff. They definitely don't treat you like a number.The office has been in Carnegie forever. I have been going there for years and have always had good direct communication about anything I need. My questions are always answered and I will continue with my dentist as long as he's there.Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!
Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) 
Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!
Its always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. 
If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!Excellent food , good service too I have had several different dishes here and all have been excellentI like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  
There is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.
I love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN.This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. 

I grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town.

Try the fried calamari "Roman Style" for a little kick!What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back.I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well.It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.

The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.

I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.

I have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.

I love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old.

We always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.

We, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience.This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. 

I moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?

I bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. 

When my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time.Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave.Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back.One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically). 

Everything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  

Then, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  

If you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).I have never posted to Yelp before, but in light of the very unpleasant experience had by our friend Katie, I figured I'd share a happier one. I LOVE the food, the prices are great and I think I'm addicted to their cheesesteaks! The staff is always funny and down to earth, they make delivery to my job speedy, and they even deal with my indecisiveness! (haha). If something was wrong with my food, I am sure they'd waste no time fixing the problem.
I always order a side of fries as they're HUGE and taste like Potato Patch (Kennywood) UHH-MAY-ZIIING. I would and do DEFINITELEY recommend Capri Pizza

***PLEASE NOTE***

 I do not stand in opposition to Katie, I really am sorry to hear of the unhappy experience, but I will say that I really do like Capri and I appreciate their staff.Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long.Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. 

Outdoor seating in the summer is nice.It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.Piano Man to the tune of Gangster's Paradise...what more do I have to say? Get there early if you want a seat, $7 cover and really fun crowd. We had sucha great time and I can't wait to go back.SingSing!!! What a blast! One of my favorite places to jam on Earth!! Cool bar, cool town, cool people... What else do you need!! The piano players are great, funny, semi-good lookin'... I mean dude, you gotta go!!! :) Love me some SingSing!If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.

Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  

I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!

It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! 

I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! 

I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!Went for my 25th birthday and had a blast! Servers are great, the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved. Only bad thing is it can get very expensive!What a great time! The pianists are funny, talented, and just a tad crude. But just enough to be funny.Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend.I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.

Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an "i" not an "l") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.

Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them.From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio's, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!

If you don't want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!

-AdamJoe Dilorio's Auto Body Shop was so helpful when I needed to get windows replaced. The were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area. They were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with. I'm planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs.This place is amazing! I needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful. They set me up with a rental car as soon as I dropped my car off, repaired my car in a timely manner, detailed it for free, and their customer service was unbelievable!!! I can't recommend this place more!I'm grateful to my insurance company for recommending Di Iorio's Auto Body Shop. After an accident, I needed some body work done as soon as possible. The other recommended shops wouldn't even make an appointment to see me for days. These guys fit me in that afternoon, and coordinated the rental too. Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense. The car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few days later, I noticed they had buffed out some scratches that weren't even part of the repair area. I will definitely be back next time I need auto repairs.SO lucky to be referred to Joe DiIorio's after moving to Pittsburgh. It's really invaluable to have "car guys" that you trust. I could detail several experiences here (in comparison to other chain shops), but suffice it to say that they've always been honest, helpful, and fair.You can find pretty good body work without too much trouble.  Finding a place that's friendly, prompt, and organized that ALSO does good body work is more difficult.  Joe Dilorio's delivers on all counts.  Highly recommended for the next time you -- or somebody else -- make a little mistake on the road.Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn't see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill. The raccoon destroyed my front bumper, the grill, and my right fog light. Thankfully I had duct tape in my trunk. Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent.

My insurance referred me to DiIorios and I'm really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate. They even set up a rental for me when I was having the car repaired. 

They kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time.

Hopefully I don't have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon, but if I do, I know I'm going to take back to DiIorios.Lowe's is my goto store for home improvement supplies. It's convenient and local to me. 
Customer service is always great and prices are fair. 
My most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed! 
THIS is what I want in customer service. Sadly, I cannot remember his name. (Bad customer on my part.) Thank you!!!Lowe's is my first stop for all of my home projects.   I am currently redoing door.  Lowe's has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the DIYs as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs.   Returns are handled seamlessly,  who doesn't grab the wrong part?  Their garden section is great for Spring planting.  They have competatively priced appliances.  5% off with Lowe's credit card is also nice.  Having those large items delivered is a convenience. Their best asset is the expertise of the staff.  I frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input.   Highly recommendedThe food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.

They have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi.Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders.Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  

My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  

I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area.Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domesticI really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  
My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...
They often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)
Anyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  

A FAMILY GATHERING!  

A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  

OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!

A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!

The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  

The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.

The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.

Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. 

WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  

POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  

A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. 

Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  

DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!

FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.

The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.

Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.

The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. 

Note the "drinks are weak" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. 

Also note the "prize center games suck" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). 

The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.

This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.

Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.

I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxedAfter having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more.Great games and prizes. Amazing food.great way to enjoy your day with your family!!! Super busy place.We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.

Kids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.

In the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.This is a high quality,clean and professional grooming shop. I feel very comfortable leaving my golden retriever with this groomer.  The focus is on clean and natural and not fancy perfumes and gimmicks.The woman working who cut my 9 month old Schnauzer was wonderful! He was very matted, not to mention nervous for his first grooming, and she still managed to do a WONDERFUL job on him! I could not be happier, especially because the people at Petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didn't have the time for it being it was a busy Saturday. Paws in the Family Pet Grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard, his chest-fur, and the fur on his legs. He looks like a Schnauzer! I am so happy!great job always!!! 
i highly recommend!!!! ;-)
mandy & randy ;-)I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.
There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.
Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.
I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.
Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!!I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic "Team Trivia". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. 

A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! 

Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!!Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews!My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  

The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure.Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!I love this place! Great food and the best beer brewed on site! The bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here.BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. 

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! 

I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.

Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.

The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.

In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. 

If you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. 

Even though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. 
I had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. 
I would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.Great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones! You won't be disappointed. The Jalapeño pretzels are dope!I have a little bit of mechanical knowledge, but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic. I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. 

I called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. 

I chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. 

Thanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles. 

(If you're curious as to their hours, I was there a little after 7AM. They are first come, first serve.) Don't be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot. Oh, and don't park in front of the garage doors like a tool!Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend.This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:

1. They sell beer!
2. Huuuuuge produce selection
3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars
4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish
5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)

The store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. 

It seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.I have to thank the bakery, once again for getting me out of a jam! Twice, Bekka, has made a great cake for my daughter when party planning was at its stress point! Her guest interaction is very professional and she always makes everything seem easy and manageable without a ripple. Thanks again Bekka!!This is a great supermarket!  All of the staples.  Great deli, market square and bakery.  Fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged.  Love the fact that I can shop, drop dry cleaning, and pick up pharmacy items in one stop.  Close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants.Such nice staff.  

I really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  

The store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  

I really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.I find this location, clean and well organized, but that's not the reason it's getting 5 stars! 

I called today to look into whether or not their May issues of magazines were out (I need them for my job) and Erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine I asked about! 

Now that is customer service! 

Well done, well done!There is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store. 

This Barnes and Noble carries on a long history of excellence. They always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking.I'm surprised by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot, fresh pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge. 

They've got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.

In the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to "Do the wave' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. I've found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. Maybe these are old reviews?One of my favorite places, and they have thee Best Lemon Drop Martini's... Plus the Bar Tender looks like Clark Kent(Superman) very handsome guyGreat atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. 

Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant.The place where my fiancé and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now! 

Jerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat. 
Buffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot tooI LOVE Sandcastle. 
First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. 

If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! 

The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!

They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. 

If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It's a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting!We went to the Sandcastle Waterpark this past weekend before we went to Heinz Field.  We are a family of four; Dad, Mom, 17 year old girl, and 8 year old girl.  We all enjoyed it.  There was plenty to do for everyone; wave pool, kiddie pools, single tube slides, double tube slides, and body slides.  It was a cloudy day in the upper 70's, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Check for coupons at Giant, Local Flavor, and other places.  Some things don't open until 12 PM, even when the park opens at 11 AM.  Parking is $6.00.For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. 

ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. 

I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? 

These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. 

Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.The only place to buy a mattress.

Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. 

Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.
 
Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. 

A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.

I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class. 

My first time in Pittsburgh, when the driver heard I was on an interview, he even gave me a free tour of a few neighborhoods in the city.I agree with the other reviewers. I tried these guys based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. 

I'm a grumpy New Englander, and have been frustrated by the small town, easygoing/careless customer service at many PGH businesses. These guys are different: professional, punctual (even in snow!).Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.Ditto everyone else. I had out of towners needing to get to the airport but I had a last minute work conflict and couldn't drive them. I was nervous about using one of the standard cab companies because their track record of actually showing up isn't great. I called these guys the night before an 8am pick-up and everything went smoothly. Dave even checked on their flight for us to make sure it was on time given bad weather. If you're planning on getting a cab to the airport, definitely use First Class.After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment.We always use First Class Limo for flights too early to take the 28X to the airport.  They even have a multi-pickup service for early flights if you are not in time for a regular reservation.Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. 

My husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!Excellent service! The driver was first class! Truly was the best car service I have ever experienced. Driver was classy, professional and kind. Great reservation service and very fair price. Do yourself a favor-skip the cab and call this car service. Reliable, professional and great value. Thank you!I'm not sure what it is about this place that I love so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 years now, and it NEVER disappoints. Its not fancy, its not unique, its not some fantastic restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! Everything I have ever ordered is good. The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet n sour, the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.

Affordable, fast, and delicious.Everyone's been to Fridays I am sure, but I enjoy the Yucatan Salad it's delicious. My children love Fridays it's usually there 1st choice. I also love the Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta very very good.While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. 

So this is the old style pizza hut. 

Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.

I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. 

Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza. 

I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. 

I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. 

It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  "No not personal...Regular." I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. 

It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage...
Until there was nothing left. 

I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious. 

But the fries were mediocre.I love this particular LOFT store! Everything is nicely set and the atmosphere is relaxing. The quality of clothes is really good and I do believe it's good value for money. They usually have more chic and classic clothes which I love. The staff is exceptional here. I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you "how beautiful everything looks on you". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area). This store feels more personal. Combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer!Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell "General Tso's" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.We recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  I am unable to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  She was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  Never once did I feel unwelcome.  I will go out of my way to eat here again.Great food, great atmosphere, little on the loud side but they have turned down the music since the last time we were here so it's much better, good service.I will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  We got seated quickly with a reservation.  Our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  He was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  The manager was also great.  We weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  I will say this - they know how to treat their customers. We'll definitely be back :)Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.This place hit the spot. 

Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. 

I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)Good food, good service, and always an enjoyable visit. They forgot to put in our appetizer order but threw it in for free to make it up to us. A good place to catch a meal if you're down around the waterfront.I used to work here!  Haha, many moons ago tho.  Usually you leave a restaurant job sick of the food and the people but even after I left I still love going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging out.  

I'm a Changs Chicken junkie and I can't stay away from it for too long.  The bartenders have always been some of the best I've ever seen no matter how many changes they've gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love it!  Says a lot about the people.  

Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pork Won Tons though are the standard fare are always amazing.  Some other excellent dishes are Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef and The Ahi Tuna.

It might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest links in the chain!Thank you so very very very much to the management Hallie.  She literally helped me with immediately with an error that was on my gift card.  

Also Hallie visited our table during our meal to see if everything and everybody was okay.

 Also our server, Aaron, was really helpful and sweet.  I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   

Very rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together.This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!Gordons in the Waterfront is exactly what I needed for new shoes after I was allowed to walk again after a fracture in my foot.  The man who waited on me was kind, patient, and even let me know about a sale going on.  The selection and quality of shoes is wonderful.  You won't get cheap shoes here but you will get the best. Worth every cent.Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.Amazing amazing place and I really enjoy to eat there and drink the prices they not high, very good service and fast .Panera is one of our family's favorite restaurants. Everything is great. Kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup. Adults usually order "you pick two". Sandwiches, salad are all very good.I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.OMG. Target is my fav store ever. I love the staff they are also so helpful and friendly. They recognize me being there quite often!!! I also greatly appreciate being able to use a target coupon AND a manufacture coupon!!!!!  I save so much money shopping  there and now I save 5% everyday using my target debit card!!!!! Ah I love this store!!!!!!!
